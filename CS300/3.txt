=====Overview=====
The existing Auction System for antique items is managed manually. People who wish to sell products find it very tough to advertise it. Also bidders need to be physically present at the auction, which retricts a large market due to inconvenience.
Our new site has the motto "Anyone,Anytime,Anywhere". OnlineAuction.com allows the sellers and bidders to take part in the auction while in the comfort of their living rooms. We  guarantee the transactions between people without our customers having to bother with the delivery complications.
