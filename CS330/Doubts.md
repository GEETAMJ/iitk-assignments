# DOUBTS IN OS<br/>
## Process Scheduling<br/>
	- What is _Contention Scope_?? Difference between **PCS** & **SCS**?? Their significance? Why is **PCS** bad wrt **SCS**??<br/>
	- **Deadline:** Why can't we sort the processes in order of *deadline* and then schedule them in order of *deadline* first order??<br/>
		- If user knows that EDF is used then he/she can submit an earlier deadline than actual to gain priority!!
## Memory Management<br/>
	- Address Binding at Compile Time, Load Time, Execution Time - What are these??<br/>
	- Prove that the algo which replaces the page to used last is optimal??<br/>
	- In list based implementation of LRU - why O(nlogn) space??<br/>
		- Simple: A node has space O(logn) for storing page frame number!!
	- Pseudo-LRU <br/>
